This is the file for the Javascript-Assignment.

The aim is to apply the fundamentals of JavaScript to develop the logic and interactivity to an HTML page.

Create an HTML list using an unordered list element, a text-box with the placeholder “item,” and a button that says “Add.”
Create a function. This function runs when the Add button is clicked and creates a new list element (<li></li>) containing the added value and appends it to the unordered list in our HTML document.
Make sure that the content of the text box is cleared when the button is clicked so it’s ready for the next input from the user
Code must be organized and explained using comments
